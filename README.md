## Experiments 
<div style="text-align: justify">
<ol>
<li>Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.</li>
<li>For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.</li>
<li>Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tre e based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.</li>
<li>Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.</li>
<li>Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.</li>
<li>Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.</li>
<li>Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.</li>
<li>Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.</li>
<li>Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.</li>
<li>Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.</li>
